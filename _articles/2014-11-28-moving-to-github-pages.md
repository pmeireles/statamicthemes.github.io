  I have decided to move Statamic Themes to GitHub Pages
  and I thought it deserved a post to explain why and how
  I would like to see it working.
---
The purpose of the site is to help the community with useful posts and list as many themes and plugins that I come across. For a while now I have wanted to do more with the site and just haven't been able to make the time to write more posts. Hopefully this move will enable the community to get more involved and allow the site to grow.

### Why Move to GitHub Pages
I love the way GitHub enables dev communities to collaborate on projects and I recently watched [styleguides.io](http://styleguides.io) launch on GitHub pages which inspired me as the community dove in to add resources. Most people these days have a GitHub account and what I like about how it is set up is that you can raise issues rather than adding comments on posts and create pull requests if they feel that a post can be improved. Again if anyone has a resource or post they want to add it is as simple as adding a pull request. I would love for Statamic Themes to become a really useful resource for all levels of the community and my hope is that this move will allow everyone to get more involved.

### How Easy Was It
I have played around with Jekyll before and it's quite a simple system to get going with, of course your content is written in markdown with YAML so converting the site from Statamic was pretty straightforward. There are definitely limitations compared to running on Statamic, especially when you use [collections](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) as I have.

- Pagination doesn't currently work with collections.
- There's is no built in search facility.
- Taxonomies may not work as well (but I am still to implement that).

All in all though I have been happy with how things have moved across and it has given me a push to get more content added, starting with adding more 3rd party themes and plugins. My plan is to move the complete Google Doc I created over to here so that users can find plugins easily.

### A Few Broken Links
I have changed the name of "Refernce" to "Snippets" as this is a much better description for what those posts actually are and in the process that will have broken a few Google search links. I have submitted a new sitemap so my hope is that things will sort themselves out pretty quickly.

### Feedback
I would love to hear from you and if you have any comments you can now raise a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/statamicthemes/statamicthemes.github.io/issues) and I will be happy to chat things through.
