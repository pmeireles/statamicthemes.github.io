  This Statamic add-on was created as an extension of the great Statamic flickr plugin created by Nikolai Strandskogen.

I have slightly modified the plugin portion of to make use of site-wide global variables fetched from a .yaml file. In addition to modifying the plugin, I have added a fieldtype that lists all available Flickr photosets from a selected user and presents them in a selection dialog box in the Statamic control panel.

Having both a plug-in and a fieldtype in the same file will allow the easy one-click creation of photo and portfolio galleries from the Statamic control panel.
