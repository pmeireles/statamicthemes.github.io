I have had some problems getting this to work on version 1.4.2 of Statamic but it should work fine on 1.5. If you have any questions, just ask me on Twitter @asduner. Special thanks to Jack McDade (@jackmcdade) for his help troubleshooting.

I hope that this documentation is useful. It is a bit lengthy but that is more for my own sake so that I can keep track of how everything works. It is actually extremely simple to use.
