Dots features the ability to pull down a predefined set of photos from the desired user's Flick stream and/or the desired user's profile info. To help you avoid messy grids, Dots features a way to define the orientation of the photos. If you only want landscape-oriented photos, for example, Dots will skip over the portrait-oriented photos.
