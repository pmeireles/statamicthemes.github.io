  This plugin for Statamic allows for easily embedding of Rdio playlists. In conjunction with a text fieldtype, this would  allow for users to add an Rdio playlist without having to directly edit templates.

Note: This plugin exists only has a filler until fieldtypes are rewritten. When fieldtypes are rewritten, I will merge this into a new Rdio fieldtype and this plugin with be retired.
