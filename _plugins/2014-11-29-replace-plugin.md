Sometimes, the things you get in life just don’t quite cut it. All you need to do is to replace those things. And this plugin will help you do just that with Statamic output. Tell it to find something and replace it with something else. You can even go all kung fu by using Regular Expressions. What’s left is output just the way you want it.

Refer to [www.gotolow.com/addons/low-replace/docs](http://gotolow.com/addons/low-replace/docs) but use `{{ replace }}` instead of `{exp:low_replace}`. Multiple is not yet working.
