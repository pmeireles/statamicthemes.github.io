### Browser Support

This add-on has been tested successfully in: Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer 10.
**Note:** Touch devices are currently not supported.

Support for Internet Explorer 9 and lower could potentially be added, please file a GitHub issue if you'd like to see IE8/9 support.

### What should you expect

1. Visiting the control panel's ("Pages"/"Dashboard") page, you will be able to drag and drop each **top level** page by clicking on the drag handle located to the left of the page title.
2. Standalone pages are "special" and are not affected by reordering nor can you drag them anywhere.
3. Subpages cannot currently be reordered.

### To Do

- Touch support
- Look into "subpages" reordering though this may be complicated by date sorting and other semantic ordering processes.
