Based on and insprired from the [zendcoder VideoJS](http://videojs.com)  plugin.

I have put together this , *my first please my PHP is very rusty*, plugin for Statamic that enables you to playback your **own hosted** video files. In other words , this is **not** for YouTube, Vimeo and so on... you should check out other plugins for that :-)
Please feel free to fork and improve on this :)

This plugin using VideoJS allows you to have a responsive, as long as your Theme is also responsive, custom HTML5 video player that switches over to Flash format when HTML5 playback is not supported in the browser.

### Prerequisites
* More than likely jQuery needs to be in your Statamic Theme , who doesnâ€™t use jQuery these days?
* Your own hosted Video files, I also use Dropbox Public files or Amazon S3/Cloudfront which works out fine too
* H.264 encoded MP4 video files , loads of apps on Windows, Linux, Mac that help you do this. As a tip use Baselin encoded video that has better results on iPhone, iPad.
* Optional : WebM video files .. handy firefox extension Firefogg and others listed at the [WebM project page](http://www.webmproject.org/tools/)  

### Installing
Drop in the videojs folder to your Statamic `_add-ons` folder

### Usage

#### MP4 and WebM in HTML 5
`{{ videojs:videojs mp4="http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4" webm="http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.webm" poster="http://sandbox.thewikies.com/vfe-generator/images/big-buck-bunny_poster.jpg" }}`

The webM video format is used mostly by Firefox (to version 24 at least) for HTML5 video playback .

#### MP4 (H.264) only
Play back a H.264 mp4 video file , and then have Flash Playback for the other browsers .  

`{{ videojs:videojs mp4="http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4" poster="http://sandbox.thewikies.com/vfe-generator/images/big-buck-bunny_poster.jpg" }}`

### Optional Settings

#### width
`width="480"` Default width is 640px

#### ratio
An optional setting, default Aspect Ratio is 16:9 format . However, I have inlcuded additional settings here:

* `ratio="4:3` 4:3 Aspect Ratio

* `ratio="16:10"` 16:10 Aspect Ratio

#### autoplay
`autoplay="true" ` Autoplay is turned off by default. Please remember IOS devices do not use the autoplay attribute, this is for data bandwidth saving. ( See Apple Docs for that)

#### loop
`loop="true"` Loop is disabled by default

#### controls
`controls="false"` Controls are enabled by default, I only see the use case for this if you are autoplaying and looping a video clip.

#### Known Issues
If you are using the jQuery plugin FitVids you may have some problems here , at the moment I have not found a way to resolve this where the video container will disappear. Any tips would be great and I can see if I can solve that.  

#### Disclaimer
I am in no way associated with Zencoder , VideoJS or even Statamic. So enjoy. If you have any tips to improve the plugin then I am open to try and
