  This plugin for Statamic allows for easily embedding of Vine videos. In conjunction with a text fieldtype, this would allow for users to add a Vine video without having to directly edit templates.

Note: This plugin exists only has a filler until fieldtypes are rewritten. When fieldtypes are rewritten, I will merge this into a new Vine fieldtype and this plugin with be retired.
