[Foundation 4](http://foundation.zurb.com) offers an excellent starting point for building responsive websites and the [Statarkers](http://www.statamicthemes.com/themes/statarkers-theme) theme offers a base set of files for building Statamic themes quickly and efficiently.

The two work together to help you create a responsive website with a blog in minutes. The theme has been kept as simple as possible so that it can form a base to build off. Feel free to use it in your projects.
